# Project Progress Log

All daily logs of implemented features, videos, and next steps.

## Day 1 ‚Äî Initial Setup & Backend Basics

### ‚úÖ Completed

- Scaffolded FastAPI project with initial folder structure and `main.py`.
- Added `requirements.txt` and installed necessary packages.
- Configured `.env` and Pydantic `Settings` class for environment variables.
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Fixed Pydantic v2 `extra_forbidden` error by matching `.env` keys to Settings fields.
- Connected MongoDB using Beanie ODM.
- Created a basic `User` model.
- Implemented test routes:
  - `POST /users` ‚Üí writes a record to MongoDB
  - `GET /users` ‚Üí reads a record from MongoDB
- Setup async worker loop with a sample test task.
- Created `Task` model and handler to trigger tasks from routes.

### üìù Notes / Challenges

- Learned about Pydantic v2 strict extra fields behavior.
- Verified async worker can run tasks triggered from different endpoints.

### üîú Next

- Setup first real backend feature (PDF upload route + processing scaffold).
- Connect frontend to display test data and worker task status.

---

## Day 2 (WIP)

### ‚úÖ Completed

- Setup minimal frontend file & folder structure
- Added `index.html` with TailwindCSS via CDN
- Implemented basic header and navigation
- Created centralized fetch utility
- Connected frontend to backend with test `GET /users` route
- Rendered users in UI
- Fixed CORS issue by enabling FastAPI `CORSMiddleware`

### üîë Issue #2 ‚Äî Authentication & User Management (In Progress)

#### Backend

- Added new fields to `User` model
- Created `Otp` model for OTP-based login
- Implemented auto-delete of expired OTPs in MongoDB
- Setup backend routes with strict input/output types:
  - `POST /register`
  - `POST /login`
  - `GET /profile`
  - `POST /logout`
  - `POST /auth` (auth check via HTTP-only cookie)

#### Frontend

- Built **register form** UI
- Implemented form handling and validation
- Successfully submitted email to backend `/register` route

---

### üîú Next

- Complete frontend login form and connect to backend `/login`
- Handle JWT HTTP-only cookies for session management
- Build protected profile page showing user info

---

## Day 3 ‚Äî Authentication & User Management (Issue #2)

### ‚úÖ Completed

**Backend:**

- Added `/register` route to accept email, generate OTP, and store in MongoDB.
- Integrated Gmail SMTP to send OTPs to user inbox.
- Implemented `/login` route to accept email + OTP.
- `/login` route validates OTP and sets JWT in an HTTP-only cookie.
- Fixed Beanie TTL index issue for OTP auto-expiry.
- Fixed DBRef query issue for OTP lookup.
- Fixed cookie persistence issue in development (localhost vs 127.0.0.1).

**Frontend:**

- Built registration form and OTP request UI.
- Implemented login form to submit email + OTP.
- Verified successful login sets JWT cookie in browser.

### üîß Notes / Challenges

- Learned about MongoDB TTL index setup with Beanie.
- Debugged DBRef vs ObjectId querying in Beanie.
- Handled cross-origin cookie persistence issues in development.

### üîú Next

- Complete login form error/success handling on frontend.
- Build protected profile page showing user information.
- Start session management with JWT verification.

## Day 4 (WIP)

### ‚úÖ Completed

- **Backend**

  - Added dependencies for route protection:
    - Authenticated-only routes
    - Guest-only routes
  - Enabled access to `auth_user` inside protected routes
  - Implemented `/logout` route to clear session cookie
  - Implemented `/me` route to return current authenticated user

- **Frontend**

  - Full **auth flow** integrated with backend
  - On page load, call `/me` to refresh auth state
  - Store current user in global `window.Auth` object
  - Added helpers:
    - `showIfAuth(...ids)` ‚Üí show elements only to authenticated users
    - `showIfGuest(...ids)` ‚Üí show elements only to guest users
  - Implemented `authGuard()` to redirect guests from protected pages
  - Implemented **logout** logic:
    - Clear global state
    - Call backend `/logout`
    - Redirect to `/login.html`
    - Added `attachLogoutButton()` helper to wire logout buttons

- **UI/UX**
  - Guest users see **Register/Login** buttons
  - Authenticated users see **Logout** button
  - Prevented UI flash by hiding content until auth state is resolved

### üîú Next

- Refine error/success handling for login/register
- Add toast/notification system for feedback
- Start building protected **profile page** with live user data

---

## Day 5 (WIP)

### ‚úÖ Completed

- **Frontend: Profile Page**

  - Implemented **profile page** to display authenticated user data:

    - Email, plan type, and other user details.

  - Fetched data from `/me` on page load and injected into DOM.
  - Ensured that UI updates **only after auth state is confirmed**, preventing flash of unauthorized content.

- **Live PDF Upload Progress**

  - Implemented **SSE-based live progress bar** for PDF uploads:

    - Created `/pdfs/progress/{upload_id}` endpoint in FastAPI.
    - Backend streams **upload progress**, `percent`, and `status` in real-time.
    - Frontend uses `EventSource` to subscribe to updates and dynamically update UI.

  - Added `/upload-pdf` route to simulate upload chunks in background task for testing.
  - Used **MongoDB GridFS** to store files (preparing for actual PDF storage).

- **Challenges & Solutions**

  - **Cookie handling**:

    - Needed cookies for authenticated SSE.
    - Solved by serving frontend from **FastAPI** to share origin with backend.

  - **JSON serialization**:

    - Enum fields (`UploadStatus`) caused `json.dumps()` errors.
    - Solved by converting enum to string before streaming.

  - **Connection lifecycle**:

    - SSE closes when upload is done; handled cleanly on frontend to avoid errors.

  - **Shared state**:

    - Created or accessed `Upload` records in DB before streaming to avoid race conditions.

  - **Frontend-backend integration**:

    - Configured `EventSource` with `credentials: "include"` for cookies across SSE requests.
    - Ensured backend CORS and SameSite settings allowed cookies.

- **UI/UX**

  - Live upload progress bar updates dynamically from backend events.
  - Completed uploads automatically **close SSE connection** on frontend.
  - Users see **real-time progress** feedback instead of static loading indicators.

### üîú Next

- Implement actual **PDF chunked upload** and save in GridFS.
- Schedule **background text extraction** tasks after upload.
- Refine error handling for failed uploads.
- Connect progress bar to real file uploads rather than simulated ones.
