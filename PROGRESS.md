    - Guest-only routes
  - Enabled access to `auth_user` inside protected routes
  - Implemented `/logout` route to clear session cookie
  - Implemented `/me` route to return current authenticated user

- **Frontend**

  - Full **auth flow** integrated with backend
  - On page load, call `/me` to refresh auth state
  - Store current user in global `window.Auth` object
  - Added helpers:
    - `showIfAuth(...ids)` ‚Üí show elements only to authenticated users
    - `showIfGuest(...ids)` ‚Üí show elements only to guest users
  - Implemented `authGuard()` to redirect guests from protected pages
  - Implemented **logout** logic:

  - Authenticated users see **Logout** button
  - Prevented UI flash by hiding content until auth state is resolved

### üîú Next

- Refine error/success handling for login/register
- Add toast/notification system for feedback
- Start building protected **profile page** with live user data

---

## Day 5 (WIP)

### ‚úÖ Completed

- **Frontend: Profile Page**

  - Implemented **profile page** to display authenticated user data:

    - Email, plan type, and other user details.

  - Fetched data from `/me` on page load and injected into DOM.
  - Ensured that UI updates **only after auth state is confirmed**, preventing flash of unauthorized content.

- **Live PDF Upload Progress**

  - Implemented **SSE-based live progress bar** for PDF uploads:

    - Created `/pdfs/progress/{upload_id}` endpoint in FastAPI.
    - Backend streams **upload progress**, `percent`, and `status` in real-time.
    - Frontend uses `EventSource` to subscribe to updates and dynamically update UI.

  - Added `/upload-pdf` route to simulate upload chunks in background task for testing.
  - Used **MongoDB GridFS** to store files (preparing for actual PDF storage).

- **Challenges & Solutions**

  - **Cookie handling**:

    - Needed cookies for authenticated SSE.
    - Solved by serving frontend from **FastAPI** to share origin with backend.

  - **JSON serialization**:

    - Enum fields (`UploadStatus`) caused `json.dumps()` errors.
    - Solved by converting enum to string before streaming.

  - **Connection lifecycle**:

    - SSE closes when upload is done; handled cleanly on frontend to avoid errors.

  - **Shared state**:

    - Created or accessed `Upload` records in DB before streaming to avoid race conditions.

  - **Frontend-backend integration**:

    - Configured `EventSource` with `credentials: "include"` for cookies across SSE requests.
    - Ensured backend CORS and SameSite settings allowed cookies.

- **UI/UX**

  - Live upload progress bar updates dynamically from backend events.
  - Completed uploads automatically **close SSE connection** on frontend.
  - Users see **real-time progress** feedback instead of static loading indicators.

### üîú Next

- Implement actual **PDF chunked upload** and save in GridFS.
- Schedule **background text extraction** tasks after upload.
- Refine error handling for failed uploads.
- Connect progress bar to real file uploads rather than simulated ones.

## üóìÔ∏è **Day 6 ‚Äì PDF Upload System (Issue #3)**

**Main focus:** Building a full PDF upload flow with real-time progress feedback using SSE (Server-Sent Events).

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

- Integrated **SSE connection** to stream real-time upload progress from the backend.
- Each upload session now uses a shared `upload_id` between `/upload-pdf` and `/progress` routes for synchronization.
- Implemented **frontend progress bar** that updates dynamically based on SSE events.
- Displayed **upload status messages** (in progress / completed / failed) in the UI.
- Continued improving integration between FastAPI background task and the frontend flow.

### üéØ Next Steps

- Add error handling and cancel support for uploads.
- Trigger and manage a background **PDF processing job** after successful upload (next issue).

---

#### üóìÔ∏è **Day 7 ‚Äî Issue #3: PDF Upload System**

**Tasks Completed:**

- Added `PDFStatus` field in PDF model for progress tracking (upload, processing, embedding, etc.)
- Created `/pdfs/list` API route to retrieve all PDFs belonging to the logged-in user
- Implemented frontend logic to display the user‚Äôs uploaded PDFs and their current status

**Next Steps:**

- Implement download and delete endpoints
- Start PDF processing pipeline (text extraction, embedding)

---

## Day 8 ‚Äî PDF Download & Frontend Refactor

### ‚úÖ Completed

- Added `/download` backend route to fetch files from **GridFS**.
- Added **Download button** in frontend PDF list ‚Äî users can now download their own uploaded PDFs.
- After each successful upload, a **background text-processing task** is automatically triggered (no implementation yet).
- üß© **Frontend Refactor:** Centralized all initialization logic into a single `main.js` entry point to avoid race conditions between scripts.

  - Handles global setup like `authGuard()` and `loadHeader()`.
  - Initializes shared promises (e.g., `currentUserPromise`) before page scripts run.
  - Dynamically loads page-specific modules based on `data-page`.

### üß± Result

- Smooth end-to-end upload and download flow.
- Stable and predictable frontend initialization for all pages.
- Foundation ready for upcoming **PDF text extraction pipeline**.

---

### üß© Day 9 ‚Äî Issue #5: PDF Processing Pipeline (Extraction & Metadata Storage)

**Progress Summary:**
Implemented the core text extraction pipeline for uploaded PDFs.
When a user uploads a PDF, an asynchronous background task now processes the file, extracts both text and HTML for each page, and stores them in a new `PdfPage` model.

**‚úÖ Completed Tasks**

- Added **PDF text extraction service** to handle page-by-page parsing.
- Introduced **PdfPage model** to store text and HTML for each page.
- Updated **async task handler** to run the extraction service after file upload.
- Linked extracted pages to their parent PDF record.
- Automatically updated the PDF‚Äôs **status** to `"embedding"` after extraction completes ‚Äî preparing for the next pipeline stage.

**üí° Outcome:**
Each PDF is now decomposed into its individual pages, with structured text and HTML content ready for embedding or further semantic processing.

## Day 10 (WIP) ‚Äî LangChain & Chroma Setup / Backend Refactor

### ‚úÖ Completed

- **LangChain / Chroma prep**:

  - Implemented `prepare_page_for_embedding()` function to fetch PDF pages and prepare text + metadata for embedding.
  - Added `PageMetadata` dataclass for schema of metadata stored with each chunk in Chroma DB.
  - Skips PDFs that require OCR.
  - Handles per-page data for each PDF and associates it with the uploading user.

- **Backend folder refactor**:

  - Moved all `./backend` files to project root (`./`) for simpler structure.
  - Updated imports and paths accordingly.
  - No functional changes, purely organizational improvement.

### üîú Next

- Implement actual embedding with ChromaDB.
- Continue with pipeline for text embeddings and vector storage.
- Integrate embedding tasks with async PDF processing workflow.

---

### üóìÔ∏è **Day 11 ‚Äî PDF Embedding Pipeline Complete**

**Commit:** [`28bfcd5`](https://github.com/morteza-rostami-cs/ai-pdf-wizard/commit/28bfcd5)

#### ‚úÖ Summary

Implemented the complete **PDF embedding pipeline**, connecting text extraction results with the vector database.
Each uploaded PDF is now embedded using a local LLM and stored in ChromaDB for future semantic retrieval.

#### üîß What‚Äôs Done

- Integrated **LangChain** for chunking per-page text into semantic units.
- Used **Ollama embeddings** to generate local vector representations.
- Persisted embeddings and metadata in **ChromaDB** (`data/chroma/pdf_chunks`).
- Implemented vector deletion by `pdf_id` for cleanup and reprocessing.
- End-to-end pipeline now covers:
  `Upload ‚Üí Extraction ‚Üí Embedding ‚Üí Ready for Querying`.

#### üöÄ Outcome

PDFs are now fully prepared for vector search and intelligent question answering in the upcoming stages.
